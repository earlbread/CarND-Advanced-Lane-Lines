    "\n",
    "This is a advanced version of [Lane Finding Project][].\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.\n",
    "- Apply a distortion correction to raw images.\n",
    "- Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.\n",
    "- Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (\"birds-eye view\").\n",
    "- Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.\n",
    "- Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.\n",
    "- Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.\n",
    "- Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.\n",

    "Image distortion occurs when a camera looks at 3D objects in the real world and transforms them into a 2D image; this transformation isnâ€™t perfect. Distortion actually changes what the shape and size of these 3D objects appear to be. So, the first step in analyzing camera images, is to undo this distortion so that you can get correct and useful information out of them."
